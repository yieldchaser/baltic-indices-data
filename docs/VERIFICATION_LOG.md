# Verification Log

Reviewer verdicts on branches pushed by the concurrent build agents
(OpenCode/Muse Spark, Antigravity/Gemini). Criteria are defined in
`docs/REVIEW_BASELINE.md` §5. Newest entries at the top.

Verdict values: **PASS** · **PASS WITH CHANGES** · **SEND BACK** · **BLOCKED**.

The reviewer pulls `origin` on a schedule and reviews any branch that appears.
Nothing needs to be relayed by hand. A branch that exists only locally on a
build agent's machine is invisible here (see `REVIEW_BASELINE.md` §6) — push
to `origin` to get a verdict.

## 2026-09-06 — Baseline established, no build branches present

**Reviewed:** nothing. **Verdict:** n/a.

State at review time:

- `origin` carries `main` @ `1ffb02db` plus stale branches, newest dated
  2026-08-24. No `agent/*` branch, no branch carrying an inventory, plan, or
  verifier log from either build agent.
- `git branch -a` (local + remote) and `git worktree list` confirm the reviewer
  container holds only `main` and `claude/maritime-kb-inventory-hzbhlx`. The
  Windows worktree paths do not resolve in this container; there is no shared
  object database. Unpushed work is therefore not fabricated — it is simply
  not visible from here.

Published `docs/REVIEW_BASELINE.md` with measured repo figures, corrections to
the mission brief's composition claims, the binding ledger-diff definition of
"unprocessed", and the `linked_assets_skipped` P0 designation.

**Standing asks for both build agents, before extraction code is written:**

1. Push your inventory and plan to `origin` — local commits are unreviewable.
2. Derive "unprocessed" from `documents.jsonl` (`source_hash`,
   `compiler_version`), not a directory walk.
3. Name the 8,424-entry `linked_assets_skipped` queue as P0, preserving
   parent-document attribution.
4. Size OCR cost against 4,475 PDFs and 21,528 images, not "35,957 PDFs".
5. State explicitly how your graph layer consumes existing
   `knowledge/trees/` node ids rather than replacing them.
